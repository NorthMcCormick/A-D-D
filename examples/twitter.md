# Twitter example

### Running

This requires an IonicDB and Firebase project to be set up with configuration files. I am not including that information becuase it is out of the scope of the project.

### What it does

This initializes two databases, two database handlers, and listens for tweets to be added, updated, or removed, and denormalizes them.
